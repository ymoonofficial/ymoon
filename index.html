                <p>Defi is hot right now. Many yearn and uniswap clones are out there. Moon is here to change that. We are focused on delivering the highest possible value to the Ethereum DeFi ecosystem by releasing innovative and game changing features.</p>

                <h2>Description</h2>
                <p>yMOON is a governance token meaning it will be used to vote on decisions to create new products in the DeFi ecosystem. You'll be able to use your coins to vote on the products to be released with your holdings. Products focused on yield farming, swapping coins, lending and borrowing among others. You decide.</p>
                <p>The potential of the moon coin is unlimited. Think about a Smart Contract where people deposit their coins that gets rebalanced every day with the most profitable APY instrument on the market, updated every second with the added benefit of being able to use fiat currencies such as USD or Euro. Or a Smart Contract that increases users funds with a massive yield per year by leveraging our YMO token to reward yield farmers. You have the power to shape the products to be created.</p>
                <p>Governance is the main power that will drive innovation forward by allowing communities like ours to shape the future of Ethereum with decisions that result in valuable products to consumers, not just blockchain users.</p>

                <h3>Presale</h3>
                <p>To kickstart development efforts will conduct a presale today at 8 PM UTC on bounce.finance where we'll raise funds to start the development process. Here are the specifics:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Starts at:</b> 8 PM UTC</li>
                    <li><b>Where:</b> on bounce.finance since it's a legit product used to raise funds</li>
                    <li><b>Duration:</b> 5 days from the moment it starts or until tokens are sold</li>
                    <li><b>Total supply:</b> 60,000 YMO tokens</li>
                    <li><b>Tokens to sell:</b> 55,000 YMO will be sold on the presale</li>
                    <li><b>Utility:</b> the remaining 5,000 YMO will be used for development efforts, to provide liquidity on Uniswap and reward participants</li>
                    <li><b>Unsold tokens:</b> any exceeding unsold tokens, will be burned to raise holders token value by reducing the supply</li>
                    <li><b>Hardcap:</b> 5,000 ETH</li>
                    <li><b>Price:</b> 1 YMO = 0.12 ETH</li>
                    <li><b>Listing:</b> the token will be listed on Uniswap after the token sale ends</li>
                    <li><b>Uniswap price:</b> the initial Uniswap price will be 1 YMO = 1 ETH since we'll use 1 / 5 of the funds raised as liquidity and combine it with the right amount of tokens, creating an instant price increase</li>
                    <li><b>Liquidity lock:</b> the liquidity will be locked on unicrypt.network to guarantee developers don't touch it for at least a year</li>
                </ul>

                <p>These token economics allow users to instantly get a return on their investments by having an improved balance ratio. We can't predict price movements but we can choose the initial ratio. That's why the token has a huge mooning potential.
